*A Book by Nnamdi Michael Okpala (Obinexus / Uche / Eze Nnamdi)*

## Overview
**The Birth of a Constitution** is both memoir and manifesto.  
It begins with collapse—housing failure, neurodivergent struggle, systemic denial—and grows into creation: OBINexus, a new constitutional and cultural framework born from survival itself.  

At its heart are three reflections of one person:  
- **Eze Nnamdi** — the king, Igbo royal blood, ancestral return.  
- **Uche Nnamdi** — the child and the mind, autistic intelligence unmasked.  
- **Obinexus Nnamdi Michael** — the connector, weaving culture, law, and technology into living sovereignty.  

Together, these voices build not just a personal story, but a generational one.

## Why This Book
Gen Z inherited broken infrastructure—housing, health, law, climate, culture.  
Where institutions failed, survival demanded invention.  
This book documents how one life—shaped by Igbo kingship, polygamous heritage, neurodivergent reality, and relentless collapse—became the seedbed for **constitutional technology**: law written in code, culture carried through design.  

> “When systems fail, build your own.”  
> — OBINexus Constitution, Article 1

## Structure
The book moves through four arcs:  
1. **Collapse** — eviction, abandonment, the civil crisis in Thurrock.  
2. **Survival** — coding in cars, libraries as sanctuaries, 61 days of documentation.  
3. **Creation** — the genesis of OBINexus, legal claims, cultural sovereignty.  
4. **Voice** — Gen Z as the generation of repair, building not for default systems but for the next person.  

Each part ties personal experience into collective lessons, rooted in Igbo heritage and projected into digital futures.
