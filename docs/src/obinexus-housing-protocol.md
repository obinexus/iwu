### **"When systems fail, build your own" - Applied to UK Housing Crisis**

---

## **1. IWU FOUNDATION: Laws for Living Together**

- Whole food = Community kitchens with fresh provisions
- Potable water = Clean running water (UK standard)
- Rest space = Minimum 8h sleep + 2h daylight rest areas
- Learning access = High-speed internet + study spaces

### **1.2 The Three Iwu Divisions in Housing**

**Iwu Computing Division** (15 homes / 25 acres standard)
- Smart home integration with Human-on-the-Loop systems
- Distributed AI for energy management
- Community mesh networks
- Remote work infrastructure

**Iwu Uche (Wisdom) Division** 
- Community learning centers
- Master-Student housing pairs
- Cultural preservation spaces
- Libraries and maker spaces

**Iwu Design & Tech Division**
- Posture-first furniture manufacturing
- Housing robotics for assisted living
- Modular construction systems
- Accessibility-first design

## **2. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PHASES**

### **Phase 0: Masquerade Returns (0-6 months)**
**Emergency/Transitional Housing**
- Partner with councils for immediate hostel provision
- Convert existing buildings using modular systems
- Implement basic HOTL monitoring for resident wellbeing
- Target: 50 emergency beds across 5 locations

### **Phase 1: Community Weaving (6-18 months)**
**Permanent Community Development**

  - Rest and recreation spaces

### **Phase 2: Cultural Export (18-36 months)**
**Scalable Model Deployment**

## **3. GOVERNANCE THROUGH IWU (LAW)**

### **3.1 Community Rules Framework**
```
Basic Iwu for Residents:
- Participation in community meals (minimum 3/week)
- Contribution to community projects (10 hours/week)
- Respect for rest architecture (quiet hours enforced)
- #NoGhosting policy for community commitments
- OpenSense communication standards
```

### **3.2 Housing Allocation Protocol**
**Priority System (OOAS-based):**
1. Emergency need (homelessness risk) = 1.0 multiplier
2. Neurodivergent individuals = 0.8 multiplier
3. Key workers/teachers = 0.6 multiplier
4. General applications = 0.4 multiplier

**Formula:**
```
Housing Priority = Base Score × Need Multiplier × Community Fit
```

### **3.3 Rent/Contribution Model**
- **Foundation Track**: Housing benefit/council partnership
- **Aspiration Track**: Sliding scale based on income
- **Community Contribution**: Skills-based exchange accepted
- **No one excluded** for inability to pay

**Remember**: Iwu (law) creates the structure for sustainable community. Without clear rules that everyone understands and agrees to, community fails. With good Iwu, community thrives.

**"Ya! Cha-Cha-Cha – Kwenu!" - We build together.**
