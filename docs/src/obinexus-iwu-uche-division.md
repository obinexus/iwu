# OBINexus Iwu Uche Division Framework
## Heart/Soul Connection + Law + Knowledge

### **Core Naming Convention**
```
OBINexus = OBI (Heart) + Nexus (Connection) 
Iwu = Law (the collection of rules imposed by authority)
Uche = Knowledge (Igbo)

OBINexus Iwu Uche = Heart/Soul Connection + Law + Knowledge Division
```

### **Service URI Architecture**
```
<service>.<operation>.obinexus.<department>.<division>.<country>.org.uk
```

Example for Design Division:
```
housing.design.obinexus.uche.iwu.uk.org
furniture.create.obinexus.uche.iwu.uk.org
```

## **Design Function Framework**
**7 Senses for Authentic Design**
1. Visual - Sight
2. Auditory - Sound
3. Tactile - Touch
4. Olfactory - Smell
5. Gustatory - Taste
6. Kinesthetic - Movement
7. Intuitive - Inner knowing

**Total: 7 + 7 = 14 Considerations for Authentic Design**

## **Design Progression Levels (0-10)**

### **Level 0: Doodle**
- Initial spark, rough ideas
- No structure, pure expression

### **Level 1: Sketch**
- Basic structure emerging
- Ideas taking form

### **Level 2: Authentic Expression**
- "This design works for me"
- Personal truth in design

### **Level 3: FUD Mitigation Expression**
- Design tailored for all
- Addressing Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt

### **Level 4: Self-Actualization**
- Design reaching its full potential
- Complete expression

### **Level 5: Cultural Preservation**
- "My culture for this"
- Think Xhosa beadwork, reggae style
- Cultural identity in design

### **Level 6: Mentor/Teacher**
- Teaching others in OBINexus
- Passing on knowledge

### **Level 7: Self-Design Impact**
- Real world implementation
- Robotics, AI applications
- NOT just for Nnamdi - for everyone

### **Level 8: FUD Mitigation for Everyone**
- Taking care of everyone
- Universal accessibility
- (Current level: 6, aspiring to 8)

### **Level 9: Development to Production**
- Like the github.com/obinexus/arty repo
- Ideas becoming reality

### **Level 10: FUD-Enlightened Production**
- Full production team implementation
- All franchises respecting constitution

---

## **Constitutional Design Clause**

**MANDATORY PAIRING:**
```
You MUST NOT have a Design franchise without a Technology franchise
Design + Technology = Complete Solution
```

This ensures:
- No design without implementation capability
- No technology without human-centered design
- Complete solutions, not half-measures

---

## **Division Structure**

### **Iwu Uche (Design Division)**
- Focus: Knowledge through design
- Location: UK headquarters
- Function: Creative authenticity + cultural preservation

### **Partnership Requirement**
- Must work with Iwu Computing (Tech Division)
- Joint projects only
- No solo franchises

---

## **Implementation in Housing**

When applied to housing development:
- Design considers all 7 senses
- Cultural authenticity preserved
- Technology enables the design
- FUD mitigation built-in
- Progression from sketch (Level 1) to production (Level 10)

---

**Remember**: "I did not go to Oxford to waste time" - This framework ensures every design serves the community with both heart (OBI) and knowledge (Uche), bound by law (Iwu) that creates sustainable innovation.
